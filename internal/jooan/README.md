# JOOAN

The `jooan` source provides local-only talkback for compatible JOOAN cameras
using their native TUTK/DTLS protocol. It has been tested with CAM720 cameras.
It does not use cloud services or provide video; combine it with the camera's
RTSP source.

Configure each camera as an alias so credentials and device identifiers are not
placed in stream URLs or connection diagnostics.

```yaml
jooan:
  patio_cam:
    host: 192.0.2.10
    port: 32761
    uid: CAM720-UID-EXAMPLE
    username: admin
    password: replace-with-a-local-secret
    speaker_channel: 1

streams:
  patio_view: rtsp://192.0.2.10:8554/live
  patio_combined:
    - rtsp://192.0.2.10:8554/live
    - jooan:patio_cam
```

The source accepts PCMU audio at 16 kHz, mono, and supports one active talkback
sender. It packetizes the audio into 40 ms frames for the camera speaker.

AV login is accepted only when a matching native response contains the required
fields and result byte 24 is zero; the advertised two-way flag is considered
only after that result succeeds. This fail-closed check does not establish full
native SDK negotiation, camera-specific profile compatibility, AV peer
privileges, or audible speaker output. Actual speaker sound remains unverified.
An AV session failure after login, including a periodic acknowledgement write
failure, terminates the send-only producer instead of leaving it apparently
usable.

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `host` | required | Camera LAN hostname or IP address |
| `port` | `32761` | Camera TUTK UDP port |
| `uid` | required | Camera TUTK device identifier |
| `username` | required | Local AV account username |
| `password` | required | Local AV account password |
| `speaker_channel` | `1` | Camera speaker channel |
| `login_timeout` | `5` | AV login timeout in seconds |

The values above are synthetic placeholders. No cloud onboarding is performed
by this source. CAM720 is currently the only verified model; other JOOAN models
may use different protocol versions, authentication, codecs, or speaker
channels.
